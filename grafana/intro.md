Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. 
It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. 
A licensed Grafana Enterprise version with additional capabilities is also available as a self-hosted installation or 
an account on the Grafana Labs cloud service. It is expandable through a plug-in system. 
End users can create complex monitoring dashboards using interactive query builders. 
Grafana is divided into a front end and back end, written in TypeScript and Go, respectively.

As a visualization tool, Grafana is a popular component in monitoring stacks, often used in combination with
time series databases such as InfluxDB, Prometheus and Graphite; monitoring platforms such as Sensu,
 Icinga, Checkmk, Zabbix, Netdata, and PRTG; SIEMs such as Elasticsearch and Splunk; and other data sources. 
The Grafana user interface was originally based on version 3 of Kibana.
