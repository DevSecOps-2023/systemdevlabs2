[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version 
control system designed to handle everything from small to very 
large projects with speed and efficiency.
Git is a popular and widely used source management system that
greatly simplifies the development cycle. It enables users to create,
use, and switch between branches for content development as easily as
people create and switch between files in their daily workflow. It is
implemented using a fast, efficient architecture that allows for ease of
experimentation and refinement of local changes in an isolated
environment before sharing them with others. In short, it allows
everyday users to focus on getting the content right instead of
worrying about source management, while providing more advanced
users with the ability to record, edit, and share changes at any level of
detail.
